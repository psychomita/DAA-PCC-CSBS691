# Assignment 2
```
Imagine that not all your connections help you equally. Some people have a positive reputation (boosting your chances
of a good introduction), while others have a negative reputation (hurting your credibility). Your goal is still to
reach Dr. Meera, but this time, you want to take a path where the overall influence score (sum of weights) is as high
as possible (or least negative).

How would you increase your chances to get best introduction?
