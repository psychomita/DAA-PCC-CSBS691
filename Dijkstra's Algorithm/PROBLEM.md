# Assignment 2.2
```
Imagine you want to connect with a famous AI researcher, Dr. Meera, on LinkedIn. You donâ€™t know her personally, but
you have mutual connections. You want to find the best way to get an introduction.  However, not all connections are
equal! Some people know each other well (strong connection), while others are just casual acquaintances
(weak connection). If you go through the strongest connections, you have a higher chance of getting a meaningful
introduction.

How would you increase your chances to get best introduction?
